# Getting Started with ROS2

Welcome to the ROS2 Knowledge Map! The goal of this document is to give a newcomer to ROS2 the tools they need to learn to start their journey of becoming a ROS2 developer. 

When I first started, I had no idea where to look for more information on certain topics, or what I should focus on next after learning a concept. I want to give a clear path to all you new developers so you can learn in a few weeks what I learned in a year. 

Alternatively, if you are a mechanical engineer, and just trying to understand the basics of ROS2, this document will still be helpful, but all of the links may not pertain to you.  Check out the Quick Start page for the bare minimum information.

## What is ROS2?

ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is an open-source set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.

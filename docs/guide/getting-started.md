# Getting Started with ROS2

Welcome to the ROS2 Knowledge Map! The goal of this document is to give a newcomer to ROS2 the tools they need to learn to start their journey of becoming a ROS2 developer. 

When I first started, I had no idea where to look for more information on certain topics, or what I should focus on next after learning a concept. I want to give a clear path to all you new developers so you can learn in a few weeks what I learned in a year. 

Alternatively, if you are a mechanical engineer, and just trying to understand the basics of ROS2, this document will still be helpful, but all of the links may not pertain to you.  Check out the Quick Start page for the bare minimum information.

## How to Use This Guide

Take your time absorbing everything. There will be a lot of information here, so feel free to take breaks, come back to difficult topics, or check out the [Glossary] page to find definitions of words.

Due to the open-source aspect of ROS2, most of the important information about developing and using it already exists and is free to access! 

The information present in this guide will generally be presented in the form of links to other sites. Links presented *like so* are vital curriculum! There may be other links that are extraneous or are good to know but not essential. These will be presented **like so**.

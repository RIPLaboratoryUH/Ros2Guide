## ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)
An open-source set of software libraries and tools that helps developers build robot applications. It acts as "middleware," allowing different parts of a robot (like sensors and motors) to communicate with each other easily. Despite being called an “Operating System”, it is not like Ubuntu or Windows, and in fact operates on top of Linux.
## Ubuntu
A popular, user-friendly distribution of the Linux operating system that serves as the primary standard for ROS2 development. It provides the essential environment and tools needed to install, run, and manage robotics software packages.
## API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to talk to each other. It serves as a messenger that takes a request from one system and delivers the response from another.
## Library
A collection of pre-written code and resources that developers can use to perform common tasks without writing code from scratch. In programming, libraries help save time by providing ready-made functions.
## Package (ROS2)
The main unit for organizing software in ROS2. A package is a container that holds your code, data, and libraries, making it easy to build, install, and share specific functionalities of a robot.
## Linux
A popular, open-source operating system that manages a computer's hardware and software. It is widely used in robotics and engineering because it is highly customizable and stable.
## Command Line
A text-based interface used to give instructions directly to a computer. Instead of clicking icons with a mouse, the user types specific commands to navigate files or run programs.
## Python
A high-level programming language known for being easy to read and write. It is frequently used in robotics for scripting, data analysis, and rapid prototyping.
## C++
A powerful, high-performance programming language often used in systems programming and robotics. It allows for detailed control over computer hardware, making it ideal for real-time applications.
## Teensy
A brand of compact, high-performance microcontroller development boards. They are often used in robotics to control hardware because they are faster and more powerful than standard Arduino boards.
## RPi (Raspberry Pi)
A low-cost, credit-card-sized single-board computer that plugs into a monitor or TV. Unlike a microcontroller, it runs a full operating system (usually Linux) and can function like a desktop computer.
## RPi Pico (Raspberry Pi Pico) 
A low-cost microcontroller chip developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Unlike the standard Raspberry Pi, the Pico does not run an operating system; it is designed to control physical hardware directly.
## Microcontroller
A compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. It contains a processor, memory, and input/output peripherals on a single chip, essentially acting as a tiny computer for controlling hardware.
